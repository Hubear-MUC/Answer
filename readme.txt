Answer 1.1
-----------

A very simple version of the "What's your name? - Hello ...." programs, which asks you for your name and then answers with a Greeting including your name.

Usually these programs belong to the first exercises everyone does when beginning to learn how to write programs, and I wanted to implement this as one of the first trials within this progress- project, however it needed so much code space that it just could be done now.

Just invoke the program after compilation.

It will ask you for your name and then greet you with your name.

In version 1.1 the prompt to enter your name was designed in a more polite way, so it does not just ask

  Name :
  
but more polite

  Your name :
  


Attention:

The name you type in is allowed to be 999 characters at maximum.
So, very, very long names exceeding the 999- character- maximum have to be shortcutted.

Furthermore:

Your name will be stored in the memory of your computer for the running time of this program.
